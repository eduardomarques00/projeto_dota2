Tooltips for Aghanim\'s upgrades now include more details about the exact numbers that change when equipped, and modified abilities also include this information in a dedicated section. Many upgrades have also received individual attention to make them simpler and easier for our non-magus minds to understand.","springcleaning22_muting_ui":"Muting Improvements","springcleaning22_muting_ui_desc":"Dota players are a boisterous bunch, and sometimes the wrong kind of emotions dominate amidst the heat of competition. In cases where that behavior becomes disruptive, it\'s important to have a quick and easy means to mute players and report them for additional scrutiny without further disrupting your game. To that end, a single click will now mute voice, mute text, and report a player. You can also right-click to mute text and voice independently for cases where a player\'s behavior may not be disruptive but their communications are still unwanted. For an easy high-level control, you can also use the new Team Mute buttons to block out an entire team\'s communications with a click.\\n\\nWe\'re also taking this opportunity to re-evaluate how we handle communication reports.
