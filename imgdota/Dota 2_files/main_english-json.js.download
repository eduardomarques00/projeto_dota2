For example, to cast TP, hold R1+R2 and press the A button. The D-pad selects various shortcuts in the UI to level up abilities, purchase quickbuy items, and open the shop. There\'s a second page of shortcuts to select units that you can access by holding R1. L1 and L2 are used to lock targets — L1 targets an ally, while L2 targets enemies. While holding L1 or L2, the face buttons will target different types of units (creeps, buildings, or heroes). Any attacks or abilities will try to target the locked unit first, to make it easier to land spells with the controller.

The road to becoming a Dota 2 Champion is a long and challenging one, but it can be incredibly rewarding. <br><br> The Dota Pro Circuit Season generally commences in the autumn and concludes the following summer. A typical Dota Pro Circuit Season lasts for 1 calendar year, starting with a Tour period, followed by The International Regional Qualifiers, and ending with The International itself.","dpc_about_format_regdiv":"Regional Leagues and Divisions","dpc_about_format_body2":"A Regional League is a round-robin-style tournament where professional Dota teams compete against one another to earn DPC Points and cash prizes. During this portion of the Dota Pro Circuit, collecting DPC Points is critical. <br><br> Teams competing in a Regional League are divided into 6 global Regions. The global Regions are: North America (NA), South America (SA), Western Europe (WEU), Eastern Europe (EEU), China (CN), and Southeast Asia (SEA). Each global Region is considered a League of its own, and teams within each Region compete against one another round-robin style. Teams that win enough matches, and earn enough DPC Points, during a Regional League will then go on to compete in a Major tournament. <br><br> Within each Region, there are 2 Divisions.  There are Division I teams, and Division II teams.  Division I teams are generally considered of a higher skill level in comparison to Division II teams. However, teams can lose their way into Division II, or win their way into Division I during the tournament. Whether or not a team moves up or down a Division is up to how many matches that team can win or lose. <br><br>Within each Division, there are 8 teams. In total, across all Regions and Divisions, there are 96 teams competing in the Dota Pro Circuit. <br><br> At the end of each Regional League, the bottom two teams from the Division I bracket will be demoted to the Division II bracket. The top two teams from the Division II bracket will then be promoted to Division I to take their place. <br><br> The bottom two teams from the Division II bracket will also be eliminated from the Regional League. These teams will then be replaced by 2 new teams, which can qualify via an Open Qualifier tournament held within their Regional League.","dpc_about_format_major":"Majors","dpc_about_format_body3":"A Major is an elimination-style tournament, where high performing teams from the Regional League compete against one another to earn even more DPC Points and cash prizes. <br><br> The 18 teams with a top placement in each Region’s Division I bracket compete in a Major. Each Region is guaranteed a minimum of at least 2 slots for teams to fill. However, some Regions are allocated more slots, as shown below: <br><br> - Western Europe: 4 Slots <br> - Eastern Europe: 3 Slots <br> - China: 4 Slots <br> - North America: 2 Slots <br> - Southeast Asia: 3 Slots <br> - South America: 2 Slots <br><br> The opening round of a Major functions like a best-of-two elimination tournament. This is referred to as a Wildcard format, which encompasses 6 teams. The top 2 teams from the Wildcard Stage progress into what is referred to as the Group Stage. <br><br> The Group Stage functions as a best-of-two, round-robin tournament. The top 2 teams from the Division I bracket then make it into the Playoffs Stage. The bottom 2 teams are eliminated. Remaining teams will duke it out in a Division II bracket elimination round. <br><br> The top, number 1 team from each Region doesn’t have to compete in the Group Stage - they get to go directly into the upper bracket of the Playoffs.","dpc_about_format_prizepool":"Prize Pools","dpc_about_format_body4":"Each Regional League has a total prize pool of $280,000 per Tour.
